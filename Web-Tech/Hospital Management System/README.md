The purpose of this project entitled as **“HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”** is to computerize the Front Office Management of Hospital and to develop software which is user friendly, simple, fast, and cost – effective. It deals with the collection of patient’s information, diagnosis details, etc. Traditionally, it was done manually. The main function of the system is to register and store patient details and doctor details and retrieve these details as and when required, and also to manipulate these details meaningfully.

Our Hospital Management System Project includes registration of patients, storing their details into the system. It will also contain doctor’s information and will digitalize the whole system. This Website has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and stores the details of every patient and staff automatically. User can search availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the id. 

The Hospital Management System can be used by entering respective username and password. It is accessible either by an administrator, Doctor, Patient. Each type of user has their own limitations except for the admin, and can read or write in the main database depending on the user rights. 

Doctor & admin is able to add, view, edit, update or delete data of the patients but only admin user is able to add, edit, update or delete doctor’s profiles. The data can be retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well protected and data processing is very fast, accurate and relevant. It also includes a power search facility by which user can search all information about any doctor and the details of a patient using any keyword.
