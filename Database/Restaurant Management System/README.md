## INTRODUCTION

A Restaurant Management System project is designed with capabilities and features to help operate and manage the restaurant hassle free. This Restaurant Management System will helps users store transactions and many other information’s including information’s about suppliers, current inventory, employee etc. Having such information stored will enable users to know if materials are finishing up, if they are having profit or loss, what items on the menu are being sold more or less and lastly it will also help know if all employees are coming to the restaurant regularly which will help users evaluate employees performance.

## PROJECT PROPOSAL

In this Restaurant Management System, information of stakeholders in a restaurant will be stored. For example, one of the stakeholders of a restaurant is a Waiter. So when a waiter is hired, all its details like (employee id, name, phone number) will be recorded.
Then, all supplier information, including details of those providing materials, will be recorded. This ensures seamless communication with suppliers whenever inventory stock  is running out. All the materials that will be stocked also has unique M_id, quantity and a price that can also be stored. This will help users know how much materials are left and if stock needs to be updated. 

Also with the help of price, user can calculate the total cost of the material purchased by the month/year basis, which will help calculate profit and loss in different time period.
Therefore this system eliminates the need to go to warehouse and count the number of materials left for future use and can rather just see the materials table and see the quantity of materials available. Later using these materials chefs can make dishes, whose information include unique (C_id, speciality, city, and phone number) is also recorded. 

The customers information that comes in the restaurant will also be recorded. Each customer has an  unique invoice number and cphone number. The phone number of a customer will help users know if the customers will return or not. If customers come back again users may give discounts to recurring customers through different their loyalty programs. Such discounts will encourage customers to visit more often and may also attract other customers to come visit their restaurant. Aditionally, if customers order through online or by phone, a unique id number and location of where it is supposed to be delivered is recorded. 

Lastly using a Restaurant Management System will help users manage data efficiently and perform multiple CRUD operation with ease. By analyzing such information users can also easily find out the annual sales data of the restaurant. Thus, enabling users to forecast future costs and empower them to make informed business decisions to mitigate potential risks or losses.
